# TIc-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a classic 2-player game where players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with their symbols (X or O). The goal is to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends when a player achieves this or all cells are filled, resulting in a draw if no one wins.
